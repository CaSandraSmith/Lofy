# Lofy

Lofy is a clone of Spotify. My favorite genre to listen to while coding is lo-fi music and this site serves that purpose! Lofy provides its users with a network of solely lo-fi music to provide mellow background sounds to increase productivity, guide users to sleep, or conserve whatever vibes the user is trying to maintain.
